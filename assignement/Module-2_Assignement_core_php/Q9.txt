 Q->What will be the values of $a and $b after the code below is executed?
Explain your answer.
$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b";

Answer:
the value of $a = '21'
the value of $b = '21'

REASON:
The variable $a is assigned the string value '1'.

The variable $b is assigned by reference to $a. This means that $b and $a are now references to the same memory location. Any change to $b will also affect $a, and vice versa.

The expression "2$b" concatenates the string "2" with the current value of $b (which is '1'). Therefore, "2$b" becomes '21'.

$b becomes '21', and since $b is a reference to $a, $a also becomes '21'
