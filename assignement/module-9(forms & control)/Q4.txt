Q4: What is Eager Loading and Lazy Loading?

A:

Eager Loading: Loads related data immediately to minimize database queries.

$employees = Employee::with('department')->get();

Lazy Loading: Loads related data only when accessed.

$employees = Employee::all();
foreach ($employees as $employee) {
    echo $employee->department->name;
}
