Q1: Explain ORM

A: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in software development to convert data between incompatible systems (object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). It abstracts database operations by mapping tables to classes and rows to objects.

Why Use ORM?

Simplifies database interactions

Makes code more readable and maintainable

Reduces SQL query complexity

Protects against SQL injection

Example in Laravel: Eloquent is Laravelâ€™s default ORM, allowing developers to work with databases using an elegant syntax.

$employee = new Employee();
$employee->name = 'John Doe';
$employee->email = 'john@example.com';
$employee->position = 'Manager';
$employee->save();
